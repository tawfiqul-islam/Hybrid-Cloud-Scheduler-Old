A scheduling framework implemented on top of Apache Mesos. Two greedy heuristic-based algorithm is implemented in the scheduling framework. In addition, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based approach has also been implemented to solve the resource allocation problem in the scheduler.

The outcome of this work is under review and titled as "Cost-efficient Dynamic Scheduling of Big Data Applications
in Apache Spark on Cloud"

Three new algorithms are added to address the problem of Spark job Scheduling in Hybrid Cloud. These algoritms are: GIO (Greedy Iterative Optimization), Job Scheduling using First Fit (FF) Heuristic, and MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming). 
The outcome of the work on hybird cloud is under review and titled as "SLA-based Scheduling of Spark Jobs in Hybrid-Cloud Environment"
