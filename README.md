A scheduling framework implemented on top of Apache Mesos. 

Three algorithms are implemented to address the problem of Spark job Scheduling in Hybrid Cloud. These algoritms are: GIO (Greedy Iterative Optimization), Job Scheduling using First Fit (FF) Heuristic, and MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming). 
The outcome of the work on hybird cloud is under review and titled as "SLA-based Scheduling of Spark Jobs in Hybrid Cloud Computing Environments"
